          I wanted to discuss about the existing API your team manages. We are
          building a new app and the /results endpoint returns a significantly

          That's right. Thorough the years - as we added more consumers - we
          receieved requests to add one more item here, there. Lesson learnt, we

          I can only imagine...so...we are building a new app. It targets
          desktop, tablet and smartphones. We would like to get only half of the
          data points for the desktop and just a few parts for the tablet/mobile
          app. You know...less screen real state to display info. Im sure you
          understand.
